3. Make user able to edit settings and save them locally on their phone

BUGS
1. Logging in(for the first time, not auto-login), letting it load your notes, then pressing the "back button", will remove all the notes.
2. Make note and leave. Edit the note, leave. Edit note -> Delete. Crashes application.
