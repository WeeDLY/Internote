4. NoteImageActivity, able to take image from phone/upload from phone and save image in firebase | FINISHED
5. Fix overall small issues
6. Deleting NoteImage does not delete the image

BUGS
1. Logging in(for the first time, not auto-login), letting it load your notes, then pressing the "back button", will remove all the notes.
2. Make note and leave. Edit the note, leave. Edit note -> Delete. Crashes application.
(3. If you create a "NoteImage", goes to main menu, and open the note, before image has been uploaded. The image won't be shown)
